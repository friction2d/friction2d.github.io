### ToolBox (toolbars)

Several toolbars have been refactored and merged into a new "ToolBox".

This release introduces a new toolbar for easy access to common properties, including transforms and related properties for selected items.

This new toolbar also includes sub-tools (node/draw mode) that were previously located in the tool selector toolbar. The color picker indicator has also been moved to this toolbar.
