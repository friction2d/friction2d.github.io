### Automatic fitting

User can set Max Error (how far from the original curve the path is) and Smooth parameters, Friction will try to adapt user's hand drawn curve accordingly.

### Manual fitting

User draws a curve, then select some matching points on it to build the path with manual precision

Pick the one which better fits your need!
