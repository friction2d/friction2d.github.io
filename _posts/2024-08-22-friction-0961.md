This release marks the end of development for the 0.9 series. The 0.9 series is now in maintenance mode, receiving only important bug fixes until the upcoming 1.0 release later this year.

This release incorporates several fixes and changes backported from the main branch.

## SVG Changes

* **Animation:** Resolved issues with `skewX` and `skewY` animations during export.
* **Defaults:** Corrected default values for `stroke` and `fill` on import to ensure accurate representation.
* **Stroke Properties:** Fixed the handling of `stroke-linecap` and `stroke-linejoin` attributes during import and export.
* **Path Fill Rule:** Corrected the `fill-rule` attribute for paths on export to ensure proper rendering.
* **CSS:** Resolved CSS-related issues in the SVG preview for improved visual accuracy.
* **Mask Support:** Added support for the `mask` element on export.

Friction now supports the `mask` element, enabling the creation of more complex and visually interesting SVG graphics.

**[Download Example Project](https://friction.graphics/assets/tutorials/tutorial-masking.friction)**

1. **Group Desired Elements:** Combine the objects you want to mask into a single group.
2. **Convert Group to Layer:** Promote the group to a layer for easier manipulation. **This step is essential for SVG export.**
3. **Apply Blend Mode:** Set the blend mode of the element you want to use as a mask to `DstIn`.

## UI/UX

* **Dockable Windows:** Resolved various issues related to the behavior and functionality of dockable windows.
* **Spinbox Widgets:** Corrected the minimum and maximum value ranges in spinbox widgets to ensure accurate input.
* **Timecode Calculation:** Refined the timecode calculation logic for improved precision and reliability.
* **Text Box Double-Click:** Double-clicking on a text box now correctly opens the associated widget, enhancing user interaction.
* **Scene Actions:** Added scene-specific actions to the main menu for quick and convenient access.
* **Rendering Interaction:** Disabled the timeline during rendering to prevent unintended modifications.
* **Global Action: Add Key(s):** Introduced a new global action, 'Add Key(s)', with the shortcut `Insert` for efficient keyframe creation.
* **Timeline Scrollbar:** Added a vertical scrollbar in the timeline when necessary to allow for smooth navigation of long sequences.
* **UI Enhancements:** Made minor adjustments to the render queue widgets for a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Core

* **Undo State:** Resolved an issue that could cause the undo state to become corrupted after importing projects on Windows.
* **Auto Timer:** Prevented the auto timer from running during shutdown to avoid unnecessary operations.
* **Project Format Version:** Implemented a check for the project format version upon loading, providing a warning if the version is incompatible.
* **User Config Directory:** Ensured that the application has read/write access to the user configuration directory during startup, displaying a warning if any issues are detected.

## Renderer

* **Render Queue:** Resolved render issues when working with multiple different scenes.
* **Image Sequence File Extension:** Ensured that the file extension for image sequences matches the selected codec to maintain consistency.
* **Output Format:** Display the output format in the queue label for better clarity and organization.
* **Pre-configured Render Profiles:** Introduced pre-configured render profiles for common media formats.

Friction will now streamline the export process by offering pre-configured render profiles. These profiles will cover common formats and settings, making it easier to create videos and images for various purposes. Available profiles include:

* **MP4 Video**
* **MP4 Video + Audio**
  * A versatile format suitable for web, mobile, and social media sharing.
* **ProRes Video**
* **ProRes Video + Audio**
  * A high-quality format commonly used in professional video editing workflows.
* **TIFF Image(s)**
  * A preferred lossless format for high-resolution images and archiving.
* **PNG Image(s)**
  * Another lossless format, suitable for graphics and illustrations.

ProRes, TIFF and PNG profiles has alpha support enabled.

## Known Issues

Friction is currently in active development, and as such, you may encounter issues or missing features. Please note the following:

* **SVG Gradients:** There may be limitations in importing SVG gradients.
* **HiDPI:** While most HiDPI issues will be addressed in version 1.0, some still persist.
* **Shader Effects:** Shader effects are still in an experimental phase and may have limitations.
* **GPU Accelerated Path Support:** Radeon GPUs may experience compatibility issues with GPU-accelerated path support.
* **Flickering:** Some projects using GPUs might exhibit flickering during playback or video export, particularly when opacity is involved.
