### What is Friction?
**Friction** is an open-source 2D animation and motion graphics software, developed as a fork of **[Enve 2D](https://maurycyliebner.github.io/)**. It is designed for animators and graphic designers who need a powerful and flexible tool for vector and bitmap animation.

### How is Friction different from Enve 2D?
**Friction** builds upon **[Enve 2D](https://maurycyliebner.github.io/)** with various improvements, bug fixes, new features while keeping most of the original features but some were removed or "hidden" because different reasons as **Friction** aims to provide a more stable, efficient, and user-friendly experience.

### Is Friction free?
Yes, it is **open source** so it is free, it will be **ALWAYS** free among lots of [other cool things](https://opensource.org/). It is licensed under the **GNU General Public License (GPLv3)**.

### Can I use Friction for commercial projects?
Yes, Friction is open-source and can be used for both **personal and commercial projects** without any restrictions.

### What operating systems does Friction support?
**Friction** is currently available for **Linux**, **Windows** and experimentally **macOS**.

### Can I contribute to Friction's development?
Absolutely! Contributions are welcome in the form of **code, documentation, bug reports, and feature suggestions**. You can check our repositories at:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/friction2d/friction)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/friction-graphics/friction)
- [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.org/friction/friction)

### Does Friction support scripting?
Yes, Friction supports scripting through **[ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)**. You can create custom scripts to automate tasks and control animations dynamically.

### How can I report a bug or request a feature?
You can report bugs or request new features on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/friction2d/friction/issues). Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

### Does Friction support GPU acceleration?
Yes, **Friction** uses **[Skia](https://skia.org/)** for rendering, which takes advantage of GPU acceleration when available.

### Is Friction an AE copy?
No, **Friction** has its own targets, focus users and features. You may find that some tools work similar to it but, please, consider **Friction** a whole different animation package.

### Do the Expression Editor has a valueAtTime() function?
At the moment **Friction** has not option to retrieve information from another frame but the actual but I will may be introduced in the next `v1.1`.

### Does Friction support Lottie animations?
No, while Lottie has its great advantages, **Friction** started supporting SVG standard animations with [**SMIL** (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language)](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/) supported by the W3 Consortium.

This might change in the future if a developer takes the challenge to build a parser for Lottie, are you that developer?
