Users can **install their own shaders** or start by installing [this bundle](https://github.com/friction2d/friction-shader-plugins) with lots of them. The installation that can be checked in `Preferences > Shaders` or changed to any custom one. More information about custom shaders can be found under **[Shaders](shaders.html)** section.

Next to an applied raster effect label, there is an icon that lets users choose who renders it if the `CPU` or the `GPU`:
