# Animation techniques

* table of contents
{:toc}

## Loops

It is possible to create **infinite loops** by mixing some Friction features:

1) Create a new scene and set up as desired. It will be a container of just the looped animation.
2) Add the assets and animate them
3) Then switch to the main scene, click on the canvas a select `link scene` choosing the scene that contains the animation you want to loop.
4) select the linked scene object, open the contextual menu (clicking the secondary mouse button) and turn on `Frame remapping`. It will activate a new parameter inside the linked scene called "**Frame**".
5) Click on the `Frame` parameter with the secondary button and choose `Set Expression`.
6) Under **Bindings**:
```frame = $frame```

7) Under **Calculate**
```return frame%30```
where "30" is just an example as it is the length of the loop, that is, if your loop is within frame number 0 and frame number 30 then set that number in **Calculate** field.

## Reveal (Trim path or sub-path)
It is a technique used to animate the "draw a path", that is, the stroke reveals or gets drawn. It works with open or closed paths but they **must be paths**, it doesn't work with circle or rectangle objects; in that case, please, convert them to paths with `Path > Object to path`.

Select the path in the **Canvas**, **Properties panel** or **Timeline hierarchy**, click with the secondary button to open the contextual menu and select `Path Effects > Sub-Path`. Expand it's parameters and play with them.

A simple reveal stroke animation could be done by animating the `max-length` parameter from `0` in one frame to `100` in the final frame. The interpolated frames will show the reveal.

## Trim path (subpath) offset

Another technique would be to play with the `offset` parameter as if, for instance, you set `min-length` to `0`and `max-length` to `10` and animate the `offset` from `0` to `90` in the last frame, the result will show a short piece of stroke moving along the path from start to end.

## Follow path

When animating the movement (transform) of an object, sometimes it is easier to build a path where you want the object to move along.

So, apart from the object it will be needed to draw a vector path where the object will move along. Select the object and add in `Transform` parameters group enable `Transform Effects` and choose `Add Follow Path Effect`. Now, set the path to follow to the name of the created path and animate the parameter `complete` where `0` is the start of the  path and `100` is the end  of it. Optionally it is possible to set `rotate` on so that it automatically rotates following the path direction.

## Masking

Itâ€™s a very used technique to fade or control the opacity of an object based on another. This way, the masking object can have any shape and even grey scale gradient to have extra control on the masking.

![Playing with offset](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_mask.svg)

If **Friction** it works as follows:
1. The objects, shapes, etc. to be masked are going to lay at the bottom.
2. On top of them all and at the same level, the masking shape. Its color must be pure white.
3. Group them all
4. Now, important, **promote the group into a layer**
5. Finally, set the blending mode of the masking object to `DstIn` (or `DstOut to mask the opposite)

So the hierarchy would have to look like the following:

![Hierarchy example](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_mask_layers.png)

In the case of masking for an **animated SVG**, it is possible to use shades of grey in the masking object. **White** color will be considered opaque, **black** color will be transparent and shades of grey a transparency ramp.

## Blend Effects

Please, don't confuse them with "Layer blending modes" as the name could be similar but the feature is totally different: **Friction** includes a smart way of handling **layer stacking** that simplifies the animation of objects that "change" their layer position with time. It is something that could be done with simpler animation techniques but `Blend Effects` really simplifies it.

![Blend Effect example](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_blend.svg)

*(**NOTE**: it's an old video so it will refer to Enve 2D animation software instead of Friction which is an evolution of the first one)*

## Expression based transformations

This technique allow users to create dynamic animations by using code (scripts) to control object properties. Instead of relying on manual keyframes, the user can use expressions to automate behaviors, connect parameters, and add randomness or complexity. There is a whole section about **[Expressions](expressions.html)**.

![Orbit example](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_wiggle.svg)

## Orbit

With a smart use of **[Expressions](expressions.html)** and Custom Properties, it is possible to archive circular movements with just `x` and `y` translations. It may be useful in several scenarios.

## Parenting

**Friction** lacks of and advanced rigging system (bones) but there is a `Transform Effect` called `Parent Effect` that helps in this regard. Additionally, using **[Expressions](expressions.html)** with simple `Clamp` functions that limit the movements, makes parenting even more capable.

![Parenting example](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_parenting.svg)

## Tracking

There is a `Transform Effect` called `Track Effect` that makes an object "look at a target", that is, if the target object moves along the canvas, the rotation of the object with the `Track effect` will animate to follow that target.

In some scenarios the target is no a visible object, in those cases it is a good idea to use a `Null object`, they can be created selecting the `Null object tool` at the **[Tools panel](userinterface.html#tools)**.

![Tracking example](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_tracking.svg)

## Text effects

Text can be animated per `character`, `word` or `line` and the effects are endless as it's possible to combine any `Transform` parameter and apply `path`, `base path`, `fill`, `outline base`, `outline` and/or `raster` effects.

## Flip book

This feature allows animators to cycle through a sequence of objects, shapes or images within a single object, enabling the creation of frame-by-frame animations. This is particularly useful for animating complex motions or character expressions that require detailed frame transitions.

![Flip book](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_flip-book.png)

This feature can only be assigned to a **Group** or **Layer** objects while all its children will act as frames. **Only one frame will be displayed at a time** and an animatable parameter called `index` will determinate which frame will be displayed.

## Morphing

This technique creates the illusion of one shape turning into a new one but the truth is that it transforms all its nodes into a new and final position but it is performed by just one path.

![Morphing example](/assets/documentation/animation_techniques/anim_techniques_morphing.svg)

Every keyframe saves the position of all nodes of a shape. They can be transformed over time, the same that happens with almost any other parameter.

The trick here is the smart way of choosing the initial and final position of the group of nodes (and tangents) that conform the whole shape.

This morphing can be done in two ways:
- **start and end keyframes have the same number of nodes**: this is the simplest and easiest way to understand the animation as all the nodes just move from the start to an end position creating the morphing illusion. 
- **start and end keyframes have different number of nodes**: in this case, **Friction** (driven by the animator indeed) decides what nodes are going to be "removed" from start to end as the path can't really animate this removal. But it will use the `dissolve node` feature that makes possible to `deactivate`and `activate` an animated node. More on this topic at **[Dissolve nodes feature](tips.html#dissolve-nodes)**.

Whether using one or the other way of morphing, **Friction** allows to `copy path` and `paste path` from one path to another (**[explained here](tips.html#copy-and-paste-paths)**). It will automatically detect if the pasted one has the same or different number of nodes and it will animate the interpolation accordingly.
By the way, it will probably need some post work on the nodes or a previous work with them as every node has an index and the node animation will be performed matching same start node index with same end node index so it will be crucial to know nodes indexes. **Friction** lets users check the index assigned to every node by pressing `ctrl + shift` (or `cmd + shift` in macOS) in your keyboard as **[explained here](tips.html#nodes-sequence)**.
