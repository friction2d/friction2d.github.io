# Export

Friction can export to various media formats.

## SVG Animation

Friction can export projects to [SVG+SMIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language#SMIL+SVG).

Note that what you see in the viewer is not necessarily what you get when exporting an SVG. Only a subset of the features in Friction are supported by the SVG exporter.

*There is ongoing work to support more features in the SVG exporter.*

* Graph
* Expressions
* Path effects
